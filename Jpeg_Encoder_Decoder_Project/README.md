# Problem Statement 
Designing an JPEG Image compression pipeline to compress coloured images of variable 
height and width

# Tech

- Python 2+
- Open CV 

# Imports
- math
- numpy
- cv2
- struct 
- bitarray

# How to run
- Open the DIP_Lab_Project.ipynb file and run all cells
- Enter the file path on which to operate
- Choose the scaling on the standard quant matrix
- Enter the output file name
- Encoded .jpg file will be save at the current directory

# Generated output images
- Generated output images can be found in output folder
- The name of the files are in the form [input file name][scaling factor on quant matrix].[jpg]

# Functions

# rgb_to_ycbcr(r,g,b)
- Takes as input the red, green and blue data stream
- Converts it to y, cb and cr components and returns them

# dct(a):
- Computes and returns the DCT of data stream a

# dct2(a)
- Computes the 2D Fast DCT of the given data stream

# quantize(a,q)
- Takes as input the data stream a and the quantizing matrix q
- Returns the quantized data stream

# run_length_encode(z)
- Generates the run length encoding of the data stream z

# huffman_code_gen(x)
- Generates the huffman code for the given data stream x

# encode(r,b,g)
- Takes as input the red, green and blue data stream
- Performs the entire JPEG Image compression pipeline and generates the output
